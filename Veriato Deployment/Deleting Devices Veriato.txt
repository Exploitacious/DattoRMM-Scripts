2. Click Configuration > Groups and Policies > Groups > then create a group, name it "Deleted users"
*Start adding or putting the machine/ user you wish to be deleted to that group & make sure NO RECORDING policy is applied to the group.

After 30 days the machine/ user would automatedly get moved to historic agents.
